This project aims to help people invest their savings in stocks. Extracted financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using yticker and Beautiful Soup. After which I visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with are Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME)
